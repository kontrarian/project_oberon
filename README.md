# Project Oberon

> The community . . . seems to be stuck with these gigantic software systems, helpless against their complexity, their peculiarities, and their occasional unreliability. . . . One wonder's where [system] designers will study and learn their trade.

Project Oberon is a text that describes the design and implementation of a computer, compiler and operating system from scratch.

I'm fortunate enough to both have run into this text (and Niklaus Wirth in general) as well as to have the opportunity to take 3 months off to try to study and understand this text.

This repository will serve as the place to store my notes, software and tools throughout this process and my hope is to provide resources to enable a smooth start for others interested in following a similar path.
